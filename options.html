Instructions:
<br>
Disable "Ask where to save each file before downloading"
and select a download directory with enough space.
<br>
We will download the files one by one.
<br>
You could run another script in the background
which frequently checks for new files,
and further processes them.
See the <code>backup-google-takeout.py</code> script.
