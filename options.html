<h1>Instructions</h1>

<p>
Disable "Ask where to save each file before downloading"
and select a download directory with enough space.
</p>

<p>
We will download the files one by one.
</p>

<p>
You also need to allow the website to download multiple files
("... automatic downloads of multiple files").
It will ask after the second automatic download or so for that.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, every 10mins or so, Google will request to reenter your Google password.
To automate this, you need to store the Google password below.
It is stored in the local storage in plain text!
</p>

<p>You could run another script in the background
which frequently checks for new files,
and further processes them.
See the <code>backup-google-takeout.py</code> script.

<h1>Options</h1>
Google password:
<input type=password id=google-password>
